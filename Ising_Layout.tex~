The Ising model can be used to describe an ensemble of spins (up or down) arranged in a lattice. Within this lattice, the spins interact with each other (as described by the interaction constant $J$). These interactions are of interest as they result in a net Magnetization $M$ of the system as it falls into thermal equilibrium.
